In-production Usage Guide
=========================

To use the application in production we recommend deploying it as a Docker image.

However you want to set up, deploy and use your docker environment is up to you. You can use simpler tools such as Docker Swarm or more advanced tools such as Kubernetes (k8s).

Because you are leveraging docker images, deployment to production is greatly streamlined and behaves very similarly to running the application locally with docker-compose.
