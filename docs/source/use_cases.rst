Use Cases
=========

The Data Resource Generator (DRG) allows you to dynamically generate a database and API with a configuration file. A DRG can fulfill many use cases, but generally, the DRG aids in automation and collaboration.

#. Quickly and programmatically stand up a database with a RESTful API.
#. Allow non-database admins to interact with databases via a RESTful API.
#. Secure and protect all, some, or no API endpoints.
#. Leverage the Open API Specification 3.0 (OAS3 or Swagger) to automate the building of API clients.
#. Share your configuration file to communicate with partners what types of data you have.
#. Automate database generation (without an API) using core parts of the DRG library.
