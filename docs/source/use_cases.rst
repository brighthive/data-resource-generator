Use Cases
=========

The Data Resource Generator (DRG) allows you to dynamically generate a database and API with a configuration file. The biggest use cases for the DRG in general are automation and data collaboration.

#. This can be used to allow non-database users to create and use databases with a RESTful API interface
#. Quickly stand up a database with RESTful API programmatically.
#. By leveraging Open API Specification 3.0 (OAS3 or Swagger) you can automate the building of API clients.
#. Core parts of the library can be used to automate database generation.
#. You can share your configuration file to communicate with partners what types of data you have.
